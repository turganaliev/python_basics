Data science is a recent umbrella term (term that covers several subdisciplines)
that includes machine learning and statistics, certain aspects of computer science
including algorithms, data storage, and web application development. Data science
is also a practical discipline that requires understanding of the domain in which
it is applied in, for example, business or science: its purpose (what "added value"
means), basic assumptions, and constraints. Data science solutions often involve at
least a pinch of AI (but usually not as much as one would expect from the headlines).
